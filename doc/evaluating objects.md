# what is wrong this this code?
```typescript
  troubleShooting() {
    // evaluation
    const expression = { x: 1, y: 2 };
    this.result = eval(expression);
  }
  ```

At a glance, the code looks like it should produce an object `{ x: 1, y: 2 }`, but if you run

```js
eval('{ x: 1, y: 2 }');
```

you’ll actually get `2`—*not* an object. The reason is that JavaScript interprets `{ x: 1, y: 2 }` as a block with labeled statements rather than an object literal.

When you use `eval`, if the first character is `{`, the interpreter treats it like a block scope instead of an object. To force evaluation as an object literal, you typically need to wrap it in parentheses, for example:

```js
eval('({ x: 1, y: 2 })'); // Produces the actual object { x: 1, y: 2 }
```

However, if your actual goal is simply to parse JSON from a string, you usually do:

```js
JSON.parse('{"x": 1, "y": 2}');
```

which is safer (and faster) than using `eval`. 

In short, the “wrong” thing here is that `eval('{ x: 1, y: 2 }')` does not evaluate to an object as you might expect. You either need to wrap the curly-brace expression in parentheses for it to be interpreted as an object literal:

```js
const expression = '({ x: 1, y: 2 })';
this.result = eval(expression);
```

Or, if it’s valid JSON, use `JSON.parse` instead of `eval`.






The error:

```
ReferenceError: mappingStatus is not defined
```

means that `eval` is trying to evaluate an expression that refers to `mappingStatus` in a scope where `mappingStatus` does not exist. Specifically,

```js
const expression2 = `({'k-content-green': mappingStatus === 0})`;
this.result = eval(expression2);
```

is equivalent to doing:

```js
eval("({'k-content-green': mappingStatus === 0})");
```

Inside that string, `mappingStatus` must be a variable that’s already defined in the same scope as `eval`. If it isn’t, you’ll get a `ReferenceError`.

---

### How to fix it?

1. **Define `mappingStatus` in the current scope**:
   
   Make sure that `mappingStatus` is declared and in scope before calling `eval`:
   ```js
   let mappingStatus = 0; // or define it however you need
   const expression2 = "({'k-content-green': mappingStatus === 0})";
   this.result = eval(expression2); // works if mappingStatus is in scope
   ```

2. **Use `this.mappingStatus` if it’s a property on `this`**:

   If `mappingStatus` is meant to be a property of the class or component (i.e., `this.mappingStatus`), you must reference `this.mappingStatus` in your expression string:
   ```js
   const expression2 = "({'k-content-green': this.mappingStatus === 0})";
   this.result = eval(expression2);
   ```
   But keep in mind that using `this` in an eval string can be tricky depending on context (e.g., strict mode).

3. **Avoid `eval` if possible**:

   If all you need is an object with a single boolean property, you don’t need `eval` at all. You can directly write:
   ```js
   this.result = { 'k-content-green': mappingStatus === 0 };
   ```
   or
   ```js
   this.result = { 'k-content-green': this.mappingStatus === 0 };
   ```
   if it’s a property of `this`.

#### Why is `eval` discouraged?

- **Security**: `eval` can run arbitrary code, posing a security risk if the string is not controlled.
- **Performance**: The JavaScript engine can’t optimize code that contains `eval` as well as code without it.
- **Complexity**: It can lead to scope and debugging headaches.

In short, if the only reason you’re using `eval` is to dynamically produce an object, you almost certainly don’t need it. Just construct the object directly in JS. If you are truly generating code at runtime, consider safer alternatives like `new Function` or a library that safely interprets expressions.
